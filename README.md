# Top Movies App

### Project Description:
This is an application where users can record and rank their favorite movies.   
The movies will include the title, the director, the release date, and the genre.   

## Machineries Used
- LucidChart (creating ERD)
- GoogleDocs (initial design collaboration)
- IntelliJ IDEA (IDE)
- SpringBoot (framework)
- Maven (dependency management)
- postgresql (database)
- pgAdmin (managing the database)
- Postman (endpoint testing)

## Design Approach

## Unsolved Problems

## Hurdles Overcome
#### Hurdle 1:
- Issue: Objects return null point exception
- Solution: Autowire
#### Hurdle 2:
- Issue: Does not know how to implement a many-to-many relationship.
- Solution: 
```
@Entity
@Table(name = "movies")
public class Movie {
    @Id
    @Column
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(unique = true)
    private String title;

    //LINKS TO OTHER TABLES
    
    @ManyToMany(fetch= FetchType.EAGER, cascade = {
            CascadeType.PERSIST,
            CascadeType.MERGE
    })
    @JoinTable
    private Set<Director> directors;
    
@Entity
@Table(name = "directors")
public class Director {
    @Id
    @Column
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String directorName;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "directors")
    @JsonIgnore
    private Set<Movie> movies;
```

- Figuring out how to implement a many-to-many relationship in Spring. Credit to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42394095/many-to-many-relationship-between-two-entities-in-spring-boot/42396995" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a>
#### Hurdle 3:
- Issue: Saving the JSON response from IMDB API
- Solution: Create a class that matches the JSON Response's properties.

#### Hurdle 4: 
- Issue: Could not delete a movie record because other tables depend on it.
- Solution: 
 ```    
  @ManyToMany(fetch=FetchType.EAGER, cascade={CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE })
  @JoinTable
  private Set<Director> directors;
  ```
- Cascade type Persist and Merge allow us to keep director entities while deleting connections between movies and directors record in the join table.
